App created with Claude 3.7 Sonnet.


PROMPT:

I want to build an app to help me choose a genre of video game to play.

The app should be web based and the UI should be responsive so it works on all devices and the user experience is good and consistent on each device.

App name: RetroRandomiser

Title screen.

Heading: Welcome to the RetroRandomiser!

Paragraph text: Can't think what to play? You've come to the right place, choose your system and we'll choose a genre of game for you to play! 

CTA button: Let's go! (when clicked the user proceeds to the next screen, system selection.



System selection screen.

Heading: Choose a system to play on.

Paragraph text: Tap a button below for the system you want to play. 

Present the user with a button for each system in the systems list.

Systems list:
Arcade
Console
Handheld

When a system button is clicked, the user proceeds to the next screen, the randomiser screen.


The randomiser screen.

Heading: Randomiser

Smaller text: Tap a button below for the system you want to play. 


Present the user with a button with the title: 'Randomise', when clicked the app should choose a genre at random and display it back to the user via the randomiser UI element. 

The randomiser UI element should animate whilst the app chooses a genre from the genre list at random. 

The randomiser should take 10 seconds to choose a genre and The randomiser UI element animation should display fun messages to the user whilst it is working. In addition, there should be a spinning wheel or tomobola animation whilst the randomiser is working. 


Genre list:
Platform
Run & Gun
Beat-em up
Fighting
Shooter
Sports
Driving

Puzzle

Under the randomly chosen category that is displayed when the genre is chosen, present to the user a button that says 'Choose again' and repeat the random genre selection process.
